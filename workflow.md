# AI-Powered Healthcare System: Agent-by-Agent Development Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines an incremental development workflow for our AI-powered healthcare system. Instead of building all components simultaneously, we'll develop and test each agent independently before integration. This approach allows for:

1. **Focused development** with clear milestones for each agent
2. **Simplified testing** of individual agent capabilities
3. **Incremental complexity** as the system grows
4. **Early identification** of issues with specific agents

    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ audio: true });
  });

  it("should create audio blob after recording", async () => {
    const chunks = await recordAudioAndGetChunks();
    const blob = new Blob(chunks);
    expect(blob.size).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});

// Test text-to-speech functionality
describe("Text-to-speech functionality", () => {
  it("should speak the provided text", () => {

    with open("test_samples/appointment_request.wav", "rb") as audio_file:
        audio_data = audio_file.read()
    result = transcribe_audio(io.BytesIO(audio_data))
    assert "appointment" in result.lower()

# Test intent classification
def test_intent_classification():
    intents = {
        "I want to schedule an appointment for next week": "schedule_appointment",
        "What are your office hours?": "general_inquiry",
        "I need to cancel my appointment": "cancel_appointment"
    }
    for query, expected_intent in intents.items():
        detected_intent = classify_intent(query)
        assert detected_intent == expected_intent
```

### Phase 4: Appointment Management Agent

**Objective**: Build the agent responsible for scheduling, rescheduling, and canceling appointments.

**Tasks**:

- Develop appointment scheduling logic

- Implement verification and confirmation mechanisms

**Testing Milestones**:

- ✅ Verify appointment creation with correct patient data
- ✅ Test rescheduling functionality preserves appointment details
- ✅ Confirm cancellation properly removes appointments
- ✅ Validate conflict detection prevents double-booking

**Test Script**:

```python
# Test appointment booking
def test_appointment_booking():
    result = book_appointment("patient123", "2023-07-15T14:00:00")
    assert "booked" in result.lower()

    # Verify in database
    appointment = db.appointments.find_one({"patient_id": "patient123"})
    assert appointment is not None
```

### Phase 5: Notification & Messaging Agent

**Objective**: Develop the agent that handles all outbound communications to patients.

**Tasks**:

- Create email notification system using SendGrid
- Develop scheduling for appointment reminders
- Build personalization logic for different message types
- Implement delivery tracking and confirmation

**Testing Milestones**:

- ✅ Confirm email templates render properly with patient data

def test_content_validation():
    valid_response = "Your appointment is scheduled for July 15th at 2:00 PM."
    invalid_response = "I'm not sure if we can help with your condition, it sounds serious."

    assert validate_content(valid_response) == True
    assert validate_content(invalid_response) == False
```

### Phase 8: Integration & Workflow Completion

**Objective**: Connect all agents into a cohesive system using LangGraph.

**Tasks**:

- ✅ Test complex multi-agent scenarios
- ✅ Confirm memory persistence across agent transitions
- ✅ Validate system recovery from errors

## Final System Testing

Once all individual agents are developed and tested, we'll perform comprehensive system testing with these scenarios:

1. **Appointment Booking Flow**:

   - User opens web app → Clicks microphone → Requests appointment → Appointment Agent schedules → Notification Agent sends confirmation

2. **Appointment Management Flow**:

   - User opens web app → Clicks microphone → Requests cancellation → Appointment Agent cancels → Notification Agent sends confirmation

3. **General Inquiry Flow**:

   - User opens web app → Clicks microphone → Asks about services → Call Center Agent responds → Content Management validates

4. **Complex Multi-Agent Flow**:
   - User initiates voice conversation → Multiple intent handling → Agent transitions → Final resolution
